# 🎙️ OpenAI Realtime API Python Client 🤖

## 🌟 Introduction

This project implements a robust and efficient client for the OpenAI Realtime API using WebSocket technology in PYTHON 😎. It is specifically designed to handle real-time audio processing and communication with the API, allowing for seamless interaction between users and advanced AI models. This client enables developers to create applications that can leverage the power of AI in real-time audio scenarios, enhancing user experiences across various domains.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎤 **Real-time audio capture from microphone**: Capture audio input directly from your microphone with minimal latency.
- 🔊 **Real-time audio playback of AI responses**: Play back audio responses generated by the AI in real-time, providing immediate feedback to users.
- 🧠 **Integration with OpenAI's gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-10-01 model**: Utilize the latest advancements in AI technology for enhanced conversational capabilities.
- 🔄 **Bi-directional audio streaming**: Support for both sending audio to the API and receiving audio responses, enabling interactive conversations.
- 🛠️ **Configurable audio settings**: Customize audio parameters such as sample rate and channels to suit your application's needs.
- 📝 **Text transcription of audio input**: Automatically transcribe spoken audio into text, facilitating easier interaction and data processing.
- 🔒 **Secure API key handling**: Ensure that your OpenAI API key is managed securely, preventing unauthorized access.

## 📋 Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following:

- **Python 3.7+**: Ensure you have a compatible version of Python installed on your system.
- **PyAudio**: A library for audio input and output.
- **websocket-client**: A library for creating WebSocket clients in Python.
- **An OpenAI API key**: You must have access to the Realtime API through your OpenAI account.

## 🛠️ Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/openai-realtime-python-client.git
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install pyaudio websocket-client
   ```

3. **Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable**:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
   ```

## 🏃‍♂️ Usage

To run the script, execute the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python realtime_api.py
   ```

Once the script is running, it will start capturing audio from your microphone and streaming it to the OpenAI Realtime API. You can stop the script at any time using `Ctrl+C`. Ensure that your microphone is set up correctly and that you have the necessary permissions to access it. For optimal performance, consider testing your audio input settings before starting the application.
